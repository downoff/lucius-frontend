## From Content Dread to Content Done

The single biggest time-sink for most social media managers is the planning phase. Here's a simple workflow that will change the way you work.

### Step 1: Define Your Content Pillars (5 Mins)
First, decide on 3-5 core themes you want to talk about this month. For Lucius, my pillars might be: "AI in Marketing," "SaaS Founder Journey," and "Productivity Tips."

### Step 2: Brainstorm with AI (20 Mins)
For each pillar, use a prompt like this in Lucius:
**Prompt:** "Act as a social media content strategist. My content pillar is '[Your Pillar].' Generate 10 interesting post ideas (a mix of stories, how-to's, and questions) for this pillar, targeted at [Your Audience]."
Repeat for all your pillars. You now have 30-50 solid ideas.

### Step 3: Draft the Posts (30 Mins)
Pick your favorite 20-30 ideas from the list. Now, use Lucius to draft the actual posts.
**Prompt:** "Write a [Platform, e.g., Twitter] post based on this idea: [Paste the Idea from Step 2]."

### Step 4: Schedule Everything (5 Mins)
Take your drafted posts and schedule them using your favorite tool. (Soon, you'll be able to do this directly in Lucius!)

And that's it. A full month of content, planned and drafted in under an hour.
